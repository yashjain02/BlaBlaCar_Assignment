# BlaBlaCar Assignment

This is assignment is meant for junior data engineer recruiting assignment. There are 2 parts for the assignemnt One is Python assignemnt and second is Data Modelling.<br />

 ## Python Assignment
 For Python assignment I have done using airflow and without airflow as well.<br />
 With Airflow you can find the dags and its details in airflow folder.
 Without  airflow you can find in python_without_airflow folder. Its scripts, how to run the scripts and details are in the folder itself.<br />
 **Note: Test case for both project are written only one time. It is in python_without_airflow/tests folder. Because both function perform same functionality.**

 ## Data Modeling
 For Data modeling assignment I have used Draw.io tool. Its description, diagram and SQL queries can be found in data_modeling folder.
